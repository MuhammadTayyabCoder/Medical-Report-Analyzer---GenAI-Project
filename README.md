# 🩺 MediScan AI – Smart Medical Report Analyzer

**MediScan AI** is an intelligent system built using **LangChain**, **Groq LLM**, and **Streamlit** to analyze medical reports and provide diagnostic insights from multiple specialist perspectives — **Cardiologist**, **Psychologist**, and **Pulmonologist**.  
It simulates how a multidisciplinary medical team collaborates to reach a comprehensive diagnosis.

**Streamlit App:** https://medical-report-analyzer-genai-project.streamlit.app/

## 🚀 Features

✅ Upload patient medical reports (`.txt` format)  
✅ Parallel analysis by:
- 🫀 Cardiologist (cardiac assessment)
- 🧠 Psychologist (mental health evaluation)
- 🌬️ Pulmonologist (respiratory assessment)  
✅ Multidisciplinary Team integration for combined diagnosis  
✅ Fully functional **Streamlit web interface**  
✅ Uses **Groq’s LLaMA 3.3-70B model** for advanced reasoning  
✅ Clean, exportable final diagnosis report

## 🧠 How It Works

1. The user uploads a `.txt` medical report through the Streamlit interface.  
2. Three specialized **LangChain agents** (Cardiologist, Psychologist, Pulmonologist) analyze the report **in parallel** using `ThreadPoolExecutor`.  
3. Each agent produces a focused summary from their specialty’s perspective.  
4. A **Multidisciplinary Team agent** then combines all insights to generate a unified diagnosis.  
5. The final result is displayed on the web interface and saved to `results/final_diagnosis.txt`.

## 🔑 Environment Variables (optional)

If you use a private API key, store it securely using Streamlit Secrets:

```toml
# .streamlit/secrets.toml
GROQ_API_KEY = "your_api_key_here"
```

In your code:
```python
import streamlit as st
GROQ_API_KEY = st.secrets["GROQ_API_KEY"]
```

---

## 📊 Example Output

After analysis, the app generates output like:

```
### 🧾 Final Diagnosis

- Possible cardiac arrhythmia due to irregular ECG pattern.
- Mild anxiety contributing to palpitations.
- Slight bronchial obstruction; recommend pulmonary function test.
```
